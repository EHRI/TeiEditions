TeiEditions
===========

An Omeka plugin containing various helpers for managing items derived from TEI.

The plugin allows you to:

 - create Omeka items from uploaded TEI files, with Omeka metadata elements populated via customisable XPath mappings
 - associate images and other tertiary files
 - create Neatline exhibits from location data in the TEI headers

It also adds various view helpers for rendering TEI-derived info and a few Neatline
shortcodes for use within SimplePages and ExhibitBuilder text blocks.
